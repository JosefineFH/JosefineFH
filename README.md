### Hi there 👋
My name is Josefine and i am from Norway. 

👩‍💻 I’m currently working on my portfolio page or my homepage. Unfortunately, it is in Norwegian. But just run google transals on the page and get it in english. So [this is my homepage](https://josfineholth.tech/).

## My Projects
### 🎮 Tech Camp
This page is hosted on netlify. And is built with the framework Vue. There is no backend on this project.

# School Projects
### 🛍 Rainyday

This project went over different topics. From design to HTML & CSS, then to javascript and CMS. So it is a cross course project.
The design is by me.
